# Multiple-choice-coding-quiz
I have create a timed, multiple-choice coding quiz that can keep track of high scores and quiz-takers' names/initials. You start off with 45 seconds on the timer and you have to answer three questions in that time frame. If you answer a question incorrectly, you will have some time deducted from your remaining timer. The quiz ends if the timer reaches zero or you answer all three questions. A final score is presented and you have the chance to submit your name/initials to the highscores. If you click on the view highscores then you can visually see a a leader board of highscores. Each player has their name/initials and score in the list. Then you can either go back and retake the quiz or clear the highscores list.
